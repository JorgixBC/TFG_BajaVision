# DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A DEVICE TO ASSIST PEOPLE WITH LOW VISION

This project presents the design and implementation of an electronic device that
assists people with low vision in detecting obstacles in urban environments. This
device will use distance sensors and artificial intelligence to identify the presence of
obstacles such as steps, curbs, or other ground-level changes.
