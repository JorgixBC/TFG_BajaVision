This project presents the design and implementation of an electronic device that
assists people with low vision in detecting obstacles in urban environments. This
device will use distance sensors and artificial intelligence to identify the presence of
obstacles such as steps, curbs, or other ground-level changes.
Nowadays, the use of electronic devices specifically designed to improve the quality
of life for people with disabilities is common. Visual impairments are no exception.
However, generally speaking, knowledge about eye-related diseases is often
reduced to a person who can see or a person who cannot see, despite the infinite
variants that exist between these extremes. Current assistive electronic devices focus
on users with total blindness, neglecting those with very limited vision that cannot
be corrected with regular glasses, standard contact lenses, medical treatment, or eye
surgeryâ€”these are known as people with low vision.
